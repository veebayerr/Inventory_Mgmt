# Inventory_Mgmt
Project for COP 4331

Create a web-based or mobile application to provide an inventory record program. The software will have a barcode scanner inside which may be used as an external library. The admin of the system will add items by scanning the barcodes first. Besides that feature the barcode also may be entered manually. Then he/she will enter the price of the item (to sell), description, expiry date, and the price of the item that is bought from the wholesale store. After adding various items, the user/worker will scan the barcodes of the items every time while selling the items on the cashier desk. The mobile device will have an ability to send various reports to some email addresses. The profit gained that day, the number of items sold that day might be included in the report. If an item is about to be sold but it's expiration date has been passed, then the system should either not allow user to sell it or should provide some discount to the item. A payment system is not required for this software project but generating an XML report may be useful if a future server integration feature should be added to the system.
